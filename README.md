## Inspiration 
It’s daunting to learn how to code as a complete beginner and a lot of us has been very lost about where to start. 

## Our idea 
Our app allows users to say what they want to learn specifically and a variety of resources telling them where to start will be customised for them 

## How we did it 
We started by setting up React and flask. We then wrote the algorithms for scraping on youtube, reddit, etc. and integrated into flask. However we didn’t have enough time to implement web design with react and therefore used figma to show the design of our website. 

## Challenges and how we overcame them 
We didn’t know how to make a webapp and therefore had to learnt how to set up flask and react and how they work together. Our team spent time at the start researching how to fully set up code for a website. 
We also haven’t used APIs and written algorithms for specific tasks before but was successful in implementing that by trying different ways and fixing bugs as we go. 

## Biggest thing we learnt 
How to code collaboratively and integrating everything together to make code coherent and readable.
Learning how best to approach learning coding and therefore we’re in a better position to make the website more accessible and easier to use. 

## What's next 
Have an inbuilt console in our webapp. 
Implementing the design with React. 
Scrape from more resources e.g. twitter, google. 
Build a chat bot within the website. 

## Built using
python, flask, React.js, Figma
